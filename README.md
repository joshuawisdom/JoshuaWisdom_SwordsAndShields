 Project 06: Swords and Shields
 This is my own work, and I did not cheat on this assignment.

 Small bug where the reset button adds 1 to the winners score. Only occurs on certain runs. I could not find a reliable way to replicate the bug.

 Completed alongside provided videos with provided materials. Sounds gathered from freesound.org. Fonts from 1001freefonts.com.
